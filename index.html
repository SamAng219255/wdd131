				<p id="bio">
					Hi, I'm Sam. I've always enjoyed and been skilled at logical pursuits such as programming and math. That, compounded with the fact that my parents are nerds as well and my Dad does software for a living, means that I began learning programming quite young and at this point I've written projects in several different languages (including my own website and an app that was on the apple app store for a while). When I'm not doing programming, I enjoy solving interesting math, playing table-top rpgs with friends, playing a handful of games (Minecraft and World of Warcraft seem to be my "go to"s these days), reading novels, and watching some animes.

					Washington, the northwesternmost state in the contiguous U.S., is famed for its Western side which has mountains, evergreen forests and the rainy metropolis of Seattle. East of the mountains which divide the two halves, the Columbia River Basin houses a semi‑arid shrub‑steppe shaped by Ice Age floods, with rolling sandy plains and basalt cliffs.
